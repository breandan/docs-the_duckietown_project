# The Duckietown experience {#part:experience status=ready}

In June 2018 we launch a redesigned Duckietown website and a re-designed Duckietown experience.

This is meant to help us scale from hundreds of users to thousands of users.

This book describes the organization of the Duckietown experience for new and old members of the community.
