# The Duckietown Experience at a glance {#dtexp-overview status=draft}



## The main websites

There is one main duckietown website, available at `www.duckietown.org`, as well as many other subsites, for regional communities, as well as special projects. For example, `canada.duckietown.org` is the entry point for the Canadian community.

### The communities {#dtexp-overview-communities}

We wish Duckietown to be used everywhere in the world, and we think the way to world domination is what we call "communities".

Each community typically has:

1. A subsite `![community name].duckietown.org`.
2. A Slack `duckietown-![community name].duckietown.org`.


**The list of communities** is available at:

[`www.duckietown.org/communities/`](http://www2.duckietown.org/communities/)

### The community managers

### The Ambassadors

Community managers that distinguished themselves gain the title of Ambassadors.

## Recruiting volunteers using "job postings"

## Other channels that we use

- Instagram
- Facebook
- Twitter


## The Slacks

There will be three main Slacks:

The Slack `duckietown.slack.com` becomes the main developer Slack. Developer = somebody who codes.

`duckietown-instructors.slack.com` is only for instructors.

`duckietown-foundation.slack.com` is for the staff of the project, who runs the site, etc.


Furthermore, we have the communities Slacks;  `duckietown-![community].slack.com` is the Slack for each regional community. For example, `duckietown-italy.slack.com` is the Duckietown for the Italian community.
